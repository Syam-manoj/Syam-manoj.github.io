I am Syam Manoj Kumar Paila from Visakhapatnam, India. I am a 3rd year UG student of the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur][IIT KGP].

I am a boarder of [Radhakrishnan Hall of Residence][RK] at KGP. Incoming research intern at [Adobe, India][Adobe] in Summer 2023.

I do not restrict my world to desks and keyboard strokes. Interested a bit about Indian history and a byte about CS. Telugu and GOT lingo is the most I'm comfortable in.
