I am Syam Manoj Kumar Paila, and I am from Visakhapatnam, India. I am a 3rd year Undergraduate student of the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur][IIT KGP]. I am from [Radhakrishnan Hall of Residence][RK] at KGP.

If you speak to me in Telugu/using GOT quotes, I'll understand you better. I like to write about programming, books, etc. You know, a programmer's world is not restricted to their rooms and desks.
