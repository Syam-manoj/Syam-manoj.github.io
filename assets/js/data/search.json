She is known for her writing style, which makes her stories simple to read. She speaks directly with the minds of us, a majority of the Indian population with her simplest language. Watch this candid talk of hers on youtube, where she talks about her urge to tell stories and how she feels uncomfortable unless she pens down the episode.She proved time and time again, that there is no need for eloquent prose or beautiful poetry for a piece of literature to connect with people, but a good story is enough. The only introduction to her works before this is an English chapter read in my school days, How I Taught My Grandmother to Read.For all the millennials out there, allow her to define feminism for you üåöüåù.If you do not know about her, here is a short intro - she was a Computer Science engineer, a teacher, a philanthropist - Padma Shri awardee, and was also an awardee of an honorary degree along with Pullela Gopichand (yes, that badminton star) by IIT Kanpur in 20191. To say the least about her works as an author, she has won many literary awards.Here are a few quotes from some of the chapters from the book that I highlighted as I read. (Actually, there were a lot more, but I had to cut down to these, so you can pick up the book to read the rest üòâ)1. Three Thousand Stitches ‚ÄúWell, if you want to change them, then you have to change yourself first. Change your attitude. Of course, it‚Äôs your decision in the end.‚Äù3. Food for Thought Who really said that India is a country? It is a continent‚Äîculturally vibrant, diverse in food and yet, distinctly Indian at heart.7. No Place Like Home The next day, on my flight back, I couldn‚Äôt help but think how fortunate we are to live in India. We may not be the richest or the best country in the world, but we have so much freedom. We can switch jobs easily or relocate to a different town or city. If nothing else, most of us have a family that will at least give us a place to stay in times of trouble. We really don‚Äôt know how lucky we are until we are out of the country.10. A Day in Infosys Foundation ‚ÄòThe truth is that I am the luckiest of them all. I love what I do and every day is a holiday for me because of it. Who doesn‚Äôt love a vacation?‚Äô I grinned.11. I Can‚Äôt, We Can In India, most of us excel at giving advice without people asking for it, and I am no exception. Dharma, on its own, also means protecting someone who needs it, no matter who they are or where they come from. It‚Äôs pure and simple, and my mind wouldn‚Äôt rest easy. I should have become high on nature, but instead I became high on alcohol. I don‚Äôt have much time left. Don‚Äôt waste your life, old friend! Learn from me. A man near his death will always tell you the bare truth. Who says money is the ultimate goal of life? It isn‚Äôt. You will find out when the time is right. One of life‚Äôs goals is the ability to understand human nature and raise a fellow being from rock bottom to becoming a useful member of society. We all lose a few battles in our lives, but we can win the war. There‚Äôs always hope.
